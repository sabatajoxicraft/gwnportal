## 🤔 FAQ

### "Why 6 weeks? Can we do faster?"

→ See EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md section on timeline. Effort is 160 hours; 6 weeks = realistic with 1 team. 4 weeks possible with 2 teams (schedule trade-off).

### "What's the risk?"

→ See BEST-PRACTICES-VALIDATION.md section "Risk Assessment". Overall: LOW. Patterns are proven, not experimental.

### "Do we need new tools?"

→ No. Everything works with current tech stack (PHP, MySQL, Docker).

### "Can we pause mid-project?"

→ Yes. Each EPIC is independent. See TASK-MANIFEST.md "Pause Points".

### "What if we disagree with something?"

→ See FULL-SITE-ASSESSMENT.md for reasoning. All decisions explained with industry references.
